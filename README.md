# oram-template

This project is a boilerplate for creating new components. It comes with two pre-built components, namely SimpleButton and RandomQuote, which you can use as references for creating your own components.

Bootstrap and Bootstrap Icons are already included in the project and ready to use. Whenever possible, please utilize standard Bootstrap elements to style your components. **We recommend that you avoid creating custom CSS unless it is absolutely necessary**.

To get started, begin with the MyComponent example provided. If your component is complex, consider breaking it down into smaller ones for better organization and modularity.

This project allows you to preview and render multiple instances of the same component with different props and configurations. Once you have implemented your component, add as many instances as necessary to demonstrate its functionality.

Before completing your work, it is highly recommended that you run "yarn lint" to check for proper coding style and fix any detected errors.

**Additional information:**

- Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides a wide range of pre-built components and styling options. It helps developers create responsive and consistent UI across different platforms and devices.

- Bootstrap Icons is an icon library that provides a collection of customizable, SVG icons that can be easily integrated into Bootstrap-based projects.

- yarn is a package manager for JavaScript that helps developers install, manage, and share code packages easily.

- Linting is a static analysis tool that checks your code for potential errors and style issues. It helps ensure code quality and consistency across the project.
